JavaFX-LotteryWheel
===================

This article shows how to use <code>TranslateTransition</code>s, <code>FadeTransition</code>s, <code>Timeline</code>s and <em>Timeline chaining</em> to implement a simple lottery wheel where names rotate around a point. The wheel reduces its speed continuously and at the end the winner name is highlighted. The names are loaded from a simple text file and positioned around the middle point. The winner is indicated by an arrow which is created with a <code>Path</code>. The <code>Font</code> size and the <code>Color</code> of the names depends on the angle where they are placed around the circle.
