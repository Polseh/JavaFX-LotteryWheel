JavaFX-LotteryWheel
===================

This JavaFX application shows how to use TranslateTransitions, FadeTransitions, Timelines and <em>Timeline chaining</em> to implement a simple lottery wheel where names rotate around a point. 
The wheel reduces its speed continuously and at the end the winner name is highlighted. The names are loaded from a simple text file and positioned around the middle point. 
The winner is indicated by an arrow which is created with a <code>Path</code>. The names which are closely to the arrow are bigger than the names which are far away and the color of the <code>Text</code> changes.
